# about your new image collection

The `cats-human-situations.csv` file contains metadata for three image objects.
The original metadata from the source institutions has been abbreviated and made
messier so you have something to clean up!

The images are in the `images/` subdirectory of this repository.

Cleanup plan:
- Get rid of all caps in titles
- Standardize dates
- Standardize dimensions
